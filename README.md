# AtlanticBT Chrome Extension
This extension is tightly coupled to Salesforce Lightning for Gmail extension. It uses the session cookie generated by the login to perform all tasks.

It also uses the [jsforce](https://jsforce.github.com) library to perform CRUD and SOQL queries against Salesforce.

Due to a change in behavior from the last Salesforce deployment up to the time of this writing, I had to fork the library and make a change to disable **jsonp.** See [GitHub fork](https://github.com/ebeltran1981/jsforce) specifically the branch **disable-jsonp** and the [issue #611](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues/611).

## Before running this project
You must clone the [jsforce GitHub fork](https://github.com/ebeltran1981/jsforce) locally, switch to the `disable-jsonp` branch and use **npm link** to create a local symlink to your local repo instead the npm one. See [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8088795/installing-a-local-module-using-npm) for more details.

This project is built using TypeScript and Webpack.

### **Libraries**
- For a complete list, see the `package.json` file under `dependencies`.

### **Running the project**
- Must have NodeJS and NPM installed.
- Must install **npm-run**: `npm install npm-run -g`
- From the project directory run: `npm install`
- Compile the project: `npm-run tsc`
- Package the files: `npm-run webpack -w`

### **Notes**
The webpack configuration file, package all the files to the `dist` folder. This is the folder to be use at Chrome Extensions to manually load the extension for development.

The project has two entry points. `Index.ts` and `Background.ts`. The first is the Content Script, the second is for communication as a background page.
